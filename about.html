<h1>About Me</h1>

I am a Software Engineering student at the University of Calgary. I have
the most experience with the programming language Java, followed by C++, Python and C.
I have also done some work with web development and relational databases.

I am a fan and contributer to open source projects, and I use Kubuntu Linux as my
personal OS.

I have just finished my third year of my degree and I am
currently looking for a co-op/internship position starting in Summer of Fall 2016.
