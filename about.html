<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
I am a fourth year Software Engineering student at the University of Calgary,
expecting to graduate at the end of April.
</p>
<p>
Last year I complete a 12 month internship at Hitachi ID Systems, Inc. as a
software testing intern, working on their Identity and Access Management
web application suite.
</p>
<p>
The bulk of my industry and academic development experience is testing and
developing web applications.
</p>
<p>
I am comfortable working on large-scale projects and have a lot of experience
working with Git.
</p>
<p>
I really enjoy technical writing and have worked with Latex often for personal
projects and during my internship.
</p>
<p>
I am excited to gain more experience in the software engineering
industry after graduation.
</p>
<p>
I am currently VP Events for the Electrical, Software, and Computer Engineering
Society.
</p>
<p>
I am a fan and contributor to open source projects, and I use Kubuntu Linux as
my personal OS.
