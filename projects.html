You can see all my open source projects and contributions to other peoples'
projects on <a href="https://github.com/athenaie">GitHub</a>.

<!--<h2>Nessie's Revenge</a></h2>
<p>
This is currently being developed as a CLI game modeled after the popular game battleship.
Right now I am working on reimplementing the work I had done previously this year from Java to Python.
Later on this game will be extended to support human and various difficulties of CPU opponents, as well as
supporting networking and a GUI for the maps. View the repository <a href="https://github.com/athenaie/Nessie-s-Revenge">here</a>.

<h2>This website</h2>
<p>
My friend made his own personal website, and it inspired me to push myself to learn some more web-page development skills.
A link is probably unecessary, but I put one <a href="index.html">here</a> anyways.
</p>

<h2>A Fun Game</h2>
<p>
This is the first game I made when I was introduced to programming principles.
