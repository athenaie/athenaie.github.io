<h2><a href="https://github.com/athenaie/Nessie-s-Revenge">Nessie's Revenge</a></h2>
This is currently being developed as a CLI game modeled after the popular game battleship.
Right now I am working on reimplementing the work I had done previously this year from Java to Python.
Later on this game will be extended to support human and various difficulties of CPU opponents, as well as
supporting networking and a GUI for the maps.


<h2>A Fun Game</h2>
This is the first game I made when I was introduced to programming principles.
